A (hitherto unsuccesful) attempt to get portal rendering to work in WebGl
by porting [CodeParade's NonEuclidean project](https://github.com/HackerPoet/NonEuclidean)
Currently failed because oblique projection is not working, his method of computing it doesn't works,
nor do any of the others I've found (e.g. Unity3D's), and I do not know enough about 3D rendering
right now to address the problem, if I can. A [submission](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63846991/calculating-oblique-projection-for-webgl)
of my issue to StackOverflow bore no fruit, so I'm realeasing this project as-is, on GitHub, feel free to fork this project.
